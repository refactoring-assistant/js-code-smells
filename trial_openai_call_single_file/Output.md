**Code Review:**

1. **Code smell no.:** 1
   - **Code smell name:** Primitive Obsession
   - **Code smell description:** Using primitive data types to represent domain ideas often leads to less expressive code and difficulty in maintaining the program.
   - **Found in line no.:** 10
   - **Possible solution:** Create specific classes or enums for vehicle types instead of using primitive strings. For instance, define an `enum VehicleType` and use this as the type for the `type` property.

2. **Code smell no.:** 2
   - **Code smell name:** Switch Statements
   - **Code smell description:** The use of switch statements for setting behavior based on `type` is an OO anti-pattern. It violates the Open-Closed Principle by making it harder to extend with new types.
   - **Found in line no.:** 13
   - **Possible solution:** Utilize polymorphism by creating subclasses for each type of vehicle (e.g., `Car`, `Truck`, `Bike`) with their own implementations of `setDefaultSpeed`.

**Example Solution (refactored):**

```javascript
class Vehicle {
    constructor(type) {
        this.type = type;
        this.maxspeed = 0;
        this.minspeed = 0;
    }

    setDefaultSpeed() {
        throw new Error("Method 'setDefaultSpeed()' must be implemented.");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    constructor() {
        super('car');
    }

    setDefaultSpeed() {
        this.maxspeed = 100;
        this.minspeed = 0;
    }
}

class Truck extends Vehicle {
    constructor() {
        super('truck');
    }

    setDefaultSpeed() {
        this.maxspeed = 80;
        this.minspeed = 0;
    }
}

class Bike extends Vehicle {
    constructor() {
        super('bike');
    }

    setDefaultSpeed() {
        this.maxspeed = 60;
        this.minspeed = 0;
    }
}

let car = new Car();
car.setDefaultSpeed();
console.log(car.maxspeed);
console.log(car.minspeed);
```

By using subclasses, each vehicle type now encapsulates its own behavior, promoting cleaner, more maintainable, and extensible code.
