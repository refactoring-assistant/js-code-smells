## Code Smell: Long Parameter List

### Problem

### Refactoring

### Executing the Examples

To execute the examples, run the following commands from the root of the project directory:

#### Running the Bad Code Example

```
$ open bloaters/long-param-list/bad/index-bad.html
```

#### Expected Output

The HTML file should render a basic shopping list, with a text entry box for adding new items and their prices to the list. Each item is rendered with its name, price and a "Delete" buttons beside it.

#### Running the Good Code Example

```
$ open bloaters/long-param-list/good/index-good.html
```

#### Expected Output

The HTML file should render the same basic shopping list, with a text entry box for adding new items and their prices to the list. Each item is rendered with its name, price and a "Delete" buttons beside it.
