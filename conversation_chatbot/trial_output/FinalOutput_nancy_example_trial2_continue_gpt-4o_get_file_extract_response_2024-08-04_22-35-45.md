- **Found in Line(s):** 33, 37, 41 (Methods: `getUserId`, `getUserProfile`, `updateUserProfile` in `User`)
- **Possible Solution:** Refactor the `User` class to reduce its dependency on the internal details of the `Account` class. Instead of directly accessing the `account` properties, consider using methods of the `Account` class to encapsulate the interaction. For example, create a method within the `Account` class to update the profile.

#### Code Smell 2
- **Code Smell Name:** Feature Envy
- **Code Smell Description:** Feature envy occurs when a method is more interested in the data of another object than its own. The `getUserProfile` and `updateUserProfile` methods in the `User` class are more focused on the `Account` and `Profile` classes.
- **Found in Line(s):** 37 (Method: `getUserProfile` in `User`), 41 (Method: `updateUserProfile` in `User`)
- **Possible Solution:** Move the logic that deals with the `Profile` to the `Account` class. This will separate the concerns properly and reduce the feature envy.

**Filename:** `duplicate-code -- Filename: dupc-example-20240706-141355-1.js`

#### Code Smell 1
- **Code Smell Name:** Duplicate Code
- **Code Smell Description:** Duplicate code exists when identical or very similar code occurs in more than one place. This redundancy leads to more maintenance work and a higher chance of bugs.
- **Found in Line(s):** 1-6 (Method: `login`) and 12-17 (Method: `register`)
- **Possible Solution:** Refactor the code by creating a separate validation function that checks both the username and password lengths. Call this validation function in both the `login` and `register` methods to remove duplication and improve maintainability.

**Filename:** `lazy-class -- Filename: lazc-example-20240709-082049-1-bad.js`

#### Code Smell 1
- **Code Smell Name:** Lazy Class
- **Code Smell Description:** A lazy class is one that does too little. It does not justify its existence and can typically be inlined into another class.
- **Found in Line(s):** 1-9 (Class: `Greeting`)
- **Possible Solution:** Inline the `showMessage` method and the `message` property into the code where the `Greeting` class is used. Remove the `Greeting` class entirely if it offers no additional behavior.

**Filename:** speculative-generality -- Filename: specg-example-20240709-082054-1-bad.js

#### Code Smell 1
- **Code Smell Name:** Speculative Generality
- **Code Smell Description:** Speculative generality occurs when methods, classes, or parameters are created to support future scenarios that may never come. This can lead to unnecessary complexity and code bloat.
- **Found in Line(s):** 11-14 (Method: `rotate`)
- **Possible Solution:** Remove the `rotate` method as it is currently not needed. If a requirement arises in the future, it can be added in a well-defined and necessary context.

**Directory:** refused-bequest  
**Filename:** rb-example-20240709-081950-1-bad.js

#### Code Smell 1
- **Code Smell Name:** Refused Bequest
- **Code Smell Description:** A subclass refuses to use the methods or properties inherited from its superclass, indicating that inheritance might not be the right relationship.
- **Found in Line(s):** 15-29 (Class: `Motorbike`), Specifically:
  - (18) `this.numWheels = 2;` (refusing the `numWheels` property)
  - (22-24) Method: `drive()` (refusing the `drive` method)
  - (26-28) Method: `park()` (refusing the `park` method)
- **Possible Solution:** Instead of inheritance, consider using composition. Create a separate `Vehicle` interface or class and have both `Car` and `Motorbike` implement or compose this shared class for the properties and methods they have in common.

**Directory:** switch-statements  
**Filename:** ss-example-20240709-081954-1-bad.js

#### Code Smell 1
- **Code Smell Name:** Switch Statements
- **Code Smell Description:** Using switch statements over different request types leads to a violation of the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) in Object-Oriented Design, meaning the code needs to be modified every time a new request type is added. This makes the system less maintainable and extensible.
- **Found in Line(s):** 2-17 (Method: `processRequest`)
- **Possible Solution:** Replace the switch statement with polymorphism. Define a common interface or abstract class for handling requests, and then create specific classes for each request type (`CreateRequest`, `DeleteRequest`, `UpdateRequest`). Use a factory pattern to instantiate and call the appropriate request handler.

**Directory:** temporary-field  
**Filename:** tf-example-20240709-082003-1-bad.js

#### Code Smell 1
- **Code Smell Name:** Temporary Field
- **Code Smell Description:** Temporary fields are fields that only get values (or are used) under certain conditions. This shows a design flaw where the field should instead be local to a method or passed as a parameter.
- **Found in Line(s):** 4 (Field: `tempDiscount`), 12 (Method: `applyDiscount`), 16 (Method: `totalPrice`)
- **Possible Solution:** Instead of storing `tempDiscount` as a field, pass it as an argument to the `totalPrice()` method if a discount needs to be applied. This eliminates the need for a temporary field and reduces the object's state management complexity.
