## Code Smell: Object-Orientation Abusers

### Problem:
As programmers, object-oriented is one of the standard and golden ways to represent the real-world entities. But many a times incorrect application of object-oriented principles generates code smells. These include the following code smells:
- Switch Statements
- Temporary Field
- Refused Bequest
- Alternative Classes with Different Interfaces

### Objective:
The following folders in this directory contain more specific examples of bad code regarding a code smell and its subsequent code smell. The following is the structure within the folders:
- The suffix "-bad.js" refers to the bad code example.
- The suffix "-good.js" refers to the good code example.

The aim is to provide examples for code refactoring to fix the code smells associated with incorrect application of object-oriented principles.
